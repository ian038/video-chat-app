# video-chat-app
A video chat app that allows me to have a basic understanding of how zoom, microsoft teams, google meets etc function.
It is what would be known as an RTC(Realtime Chat) App.

To get started, clone the project and run npm i && npm run start in both the client side and server side to launch the app locally.
